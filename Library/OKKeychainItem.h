@interface OKKeychainItem : NSObject

// Indicates which access group an item is in. Access groups can be used to share
// keychain items among two or more applications. For applications to share a
// keychain item, the applications must have a common access group listed in their
// keychain-access-groups entitlement, and the application adding the shared item
// to the keychain must specify this shared access-group name as the value for this
// key in the dictionary passed to the SecItemAdd function.
//
// An application can be a member of any number of access groups. By default, the
// SecItemUpdate, SecItemDelete, and SecItemCopyMatching functions search all the
// access groups an application is a member of. Include this key in the search
// dictionary for these functions to specify which access group is searched.
//
// A keychain item can be in only a single access group.
