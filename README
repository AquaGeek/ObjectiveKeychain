ObjectiveKeychain is an Objective-C wrapper around Apple's Keychain Services
for iOS. It allows you to easily save and retrieve items from the system's
keychain.

Generic and Internet passwords are mostly functional. Better support for
finding existing items needs to be added, and key/certificate support still
needs to be added.
